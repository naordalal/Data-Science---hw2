# Try n.1
## naive bayes algorithm
This algorithm try to compute the probability that a person who survived has the records that are given, against the probability that a person who didnt survived as those records, by referring to each record as independent from the others and choosing by the higher probability.

# Try n.2
## C50 algorithm
Decision trees and rule-based models for pattern recognition.

## Our algorithm
We took 4 algorithms: RPART, C50, XGB, GBM.
We run the algorithms on the data, and decide that people survived only if 2 of the algorithm return 1.
